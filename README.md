Title: Temporal Variation in Psychosocial Factors and Physical Activity Levels Amongst Patients with Heart Failure.

Methods: The MObile health interVention to INcrease activity in Heart Failure (MOVIN-HF) study was a prospective, observational study of patients with symptomatic HF. We collected data on: 
1) psychosocial traits at baseline and
2) twice daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for 28 days of participantsâ€™ symptoms and current psychosocial states.
3) Physical activity was measured by smartwatch step counts. Participants were provided with a smartwatch (Fitbit Versa 2). 

Aims: 
1. We evaluated the association between baseline psychosocial states and mean daily step counts and between EMAs of symptoms.
2. We also examined the association between psychosocial states and short-term step counts (12-hours after EMA).
