Title: Temporal Variation in Psychosocial Factors and Physical Activity Levels Amongst Patients with Heart Failure.

Methods: The MObile health interVention to INcrease activity in Heart Failure (MOVIN-HF) study was a prospective, observational study of patients with symptomatic HF. 

We collected data on:
1.	Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics
2.	Psychosocial traits at baseline and 4-weeks
3.	Twice daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for 28 days of participantsâ€™ heart failure symptoms and current psychosocial states
4.	Physical activity (step count) from study provided smartwatch (Fitbit Versa 2).

Aims:
1.	We evaluated the association between baseline psychosocial traits and mean daily step count.
2.	We evaluated the association between EMAs of psychosocial states and short-term step count (12-hours after EMA [primary] and 4-hours after EMA [exploratory]).
